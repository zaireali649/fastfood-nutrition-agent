Fast Food Nutrition Agent Streamlit Application.

This module provides a web interface for the Fast Food Nutrition Agent,
allowing users to input their dietary preferences and receive personalized
meal recommendations from fast food restaurants.

The application uses Streamlit for the user interface and integrates with
the OpenAI agents library to generate nutrition-focused meal suggestions
based on user requirements including calorie limits, dietary restrictions,
and restaurant preferences.

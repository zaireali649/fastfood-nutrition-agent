## 🆘 Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

1. **Streamlit Issue**
   - Revert git commit
   - Force redeploy in Streamlit Share
   - Check logs for errors

2. **Database Issue**
   - Disable database in secrets (app falls back to JSON)
   - Restore from Supabase backup
   - Re-run schema if needed

3. **Cost Overrun**
   - Reduce rate limits in code
   - Lower max_tokens
   - Temporarily disable app

---

## 📊 Success Metrics
